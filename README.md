Rust implementation of a JSON to SQL from goflow2














## Tuning

Current test:
json file of 537M with 852,381 records.

Just to isolate the JSON parsing if we remove the inserts

The entire file as one massive transaction (postgres is going to curse me, but somehow it works...).

High and very consistent block I/O

### 50k transactions

Every 50k records we commit the transaction

### Bulk-insert (no transactions)

1k block - 0:38.00
2k block - 0:37.00
3k block - 0:36.04
4k block - 0:35.79

At 5k blocks or larger the program panics with the following error:
```
Failed to insert rows: Protocol("PgConnection::run(): too many arguments for query: 80000 (sqlx_postgres::connection::executor:216)")
```
